<!-- ===== Authoring guideline (front matter) =====
Use the new plural key `types` when a work belongs to multiple categories. Keep `type` for backward compatibility.

Examples:

# Single type (old or new â€” both OK)
# type: "Project"
# OR
# types: ["Project"]

# Multiple types
# types: ["Project", "Exhibition"]

# (Optional) You can keep `type: "Project"` alongside; the code normalizes using `types` first.
