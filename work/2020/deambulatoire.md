  Residency program <i>Pop-Up 17</i>, at La Filature du Mazel, Notre-Dame-de-la-Rouvière, France.<br><br>Organized by Julien Bouissou.
description: >
  During this short seven-day residency, I carried out daily walks around the living space, collecting objects scattered throughout the landscape along the banks of the Hérault River. These included stones, plants, wood, and waste—each item accompanied by a note indicating its location and nature. Discovered along my paths between river, mountain, and village, these elements were selected, displaced, and arranged in a single interior space—a white cube.These “remains,” mundane in the eyes of the locals, were highlighted and made visible by being placed on geometric pedestals I built myself. Identical, modular, and of equal size—these dimensions were chosen in reference to the columns visible in the residency site. Thus, my intervention on the displayed objects was deliberately minimal: selecting — moving — placing on a pedestal. The act of making was replaced by the repetitive production of pedestals, evoking a kind of industrial process. In this approach, the role of the artist becomes that of a builder of display walls. In the exhibition layout, I also chose to leave certain existing elements of the space visible. These were not placed on pedestals, but directly on the floor: a neon light, a radiator, the mattress I rested on during the residency, and a few remaining modules.
