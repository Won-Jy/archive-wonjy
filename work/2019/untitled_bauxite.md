  Work conceived under the supervision of Brigitte Bauer and Jean-Marc Cérino, as part of the exhibition <i>Corpus</i> at the Maison Consulaire in Mende in 2019.
description: >
  This work is a sculpture combining bauxite stones that I collected during a trip to Villeveyrac while I was in my third year at the École des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes in 2019, along with photographs of these stones. The image shown at the top is a photograph I took in the quarry to record the shape of each stone. I arranged the stones on the ground before photographing them. Later, for a student project exhibition, I transported these stones to an exhibition space in Mende and arranged them on the floor according to their positions in the photograph. I then printed this photograph at a 1:1 scale on an aluminium dibond panel, which I placed directly on top of the arranged stones. The photograph, made physical and presented in space, and the stones, supporting their own illusion, thus acquire a particular sculptural position in which the three layers of “the image – the support – the substance” meet vertically. Moreover, the aluminium dibond support panel is an industrial product made from aluminium, a mineral extracted from bauxite, thereby creating a contact between the artificial and its natural resource.
