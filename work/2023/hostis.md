  Site specific installation, Nîmes, France.
description: |
  Located in the heart of the Pissevin district in Nîmes, the exhibition « Hostis » takes place in the former premises of a Muslim funeral home, far removed from the conventional universe of contemporary art. This neighborhood, a witness to the utopian architecture of the 1960s–70s « Grands Ensembles », is currently marked by degradation and drug trafficking. In this context, the location serves as the ideal backdrop for a unique metamorphosis. This space, awaiting demolition and originally chosen as a creative site, has been transformed into an unconventional indoor garden. It is not an ordinary garden: it emerges from soil mixed with plant debris, pigeon droppings, and concrete rubble. Plants from the surrounding area of the neighborhood were replanted with their original soil, containing other seeds, thus giving rise to unexpected new growth. These plants are also encouraged to reproduce within this semi-enclosed ecosystem, where I integrate myself as part of the life cycle of this space, attracting and fostering the presence of various living beings.
