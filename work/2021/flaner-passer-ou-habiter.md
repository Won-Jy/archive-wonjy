  <p>Solo exhibition at Château d’Assas Le Vigan.</p><p>Curated by Laurent Puech.</p>
description: >
  This exhibition retraces a journey through the rivers and rocks of the Cévennes, as well as the traces left by human presence. The artist mixed stones, sand, and pebbles collected from the riverbed into concrete, creating sculptures that evoke beds or pieces of furniture, while also presenting installations that reinterpret inverted ornamental molds and fountain decorations. In the interplay between natural elements and artificial structures, the work explores the different sensibilities of “inhabiting, passing through, or wandering,” prompting reflection on the various ways of engaging with the world.
