summary: >
  <p>Solo exhibition at Château d’Assas Le Vigan.</p><p>Curated by Laurent Puech.</p>
description: >
  <p>This exhibition retraces my journey through the rivers and rocks of the Cévennes, as well as the traces left by human presence. It also reflects a stone’s journey, floating down the river from the top of the mountain to the bottom, rolling and colliding with other stones — a movement that I associate with <i>wandering, passing through, or inhabiting</i>. I displayed stones in diverse scales and states: sand, pebbles, and stones — either simply placed, manipulated, or mixed.</p><p>I also integrated materials collected from the riverbed into concrete, creating sculptures that evoke hostile architectural structures. Alongside these, I engaged with existing elements of the exhibition space itself — such as wall scones and the mascaron of a disused fountain — by reinterpreting their forms and counter-forms.</p>
