    Alix Jolly and Else Bedoux are young artists based in the south of France, who graduated from the École supérieure des beaux-arts de Nîmes in 2025 and 2022, respectively. Alix Jolly primarily engages in original artistic experimentation through mixed-genre practices such as installation, weaving, and performance. Else Bedoux, an artist and editor, is interested not only in the essence and production of images but also in their modes of circulation and consumption. Her work explores the use of Xerox printing techniques as well as the materiality of media. (written in 2025)
